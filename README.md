## Overview
The **"JavaScript in 30 Days"** challenge is a structured, self-paced learning program designed to teach JavaScript from foundational to intermediate levels through daily exercises and a practical project.  

Aimed at beginners with basic programming knowledge or intermediate developers, this curriculum culminates in building a **command-line task manager application** using Node.js and popular libraries.  

---

## Objectives
- Master JavaScript fundamentals, including syntax, data types, and control structures.  
- Understand asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
- Gain proficiency in Node.js for command-line application development.  
- Develop a **task manager** to apply concepts like file I/O, user input, and CLI design.  
- Explore modern JavaScript libraries for enhanced functionality.  

---

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Install the latest LTS version (e.g., 18.x or 20.x) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).  
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code or a similar editor.  
- **Terminal**: Access to Bash, PowerShell, or Command Prompt.  
- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, loops, functions).  
- **Optional**: Git for version control and npm/yarn (npm comes with Node.js).
